## Capabilities

- LuaObfuscator.com  
- Luraph v14.2/v14.3  
- MoonSec  

## Version
Current Version: `v0.0.3 (9-3-25)`

## Commands
- `/find [search]`: Searches for the top 30 repositories matching your query and displays them with detected obfuscators.  
- `/search [repo_name]`: Provides detailed information for a specific repository (e.g., `torvalds/linux`), including obfuscation details.
